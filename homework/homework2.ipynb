    "We can prove that Prim algorithm can find a minimum cost spanning tree.\n",

    "Basis: Obviously holds when there is only one node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalization: If a step holds, the current set of edges is F , which belongs to T the MST, and the next step is to join the edge e .\n",
    "\n",
    "If e belongs to T , then it holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise consider another edge f on the ring T+e that can be added to the current edge set .\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the weight of f must not be smaller than the weight of e, otherwise f would be chosen over e. Then, the weight of f must not be smaller than the weight of e.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the weight of f must be no greater than the weight of f , otherwise T+e-f would be a smaller spanning tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, e and f have equal weights, and T+e-f is also a minimum spanning tree and contains F .\n",
    "\n",
    "And since no two edges have the same weight, there is no any f in this proces, the minimum spanning tree is unique.\n",
